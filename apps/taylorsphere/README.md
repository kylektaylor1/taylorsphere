## Design System

### Fonts & Text

1. Fonts in use
   a. We will use "Teko" for our display (heading) font and "Ubuntu" for our body font.
2. Text sizing
   b. Section Header: `font-display text-6xl font-medium tracking-wider`
   c. Section Description:`text-xl font-medium`

### Spacing

1. We will use a power of 2 for spacing
   a. Base spacing (2^4) = 16px -- most component level padding
   a. Large spacing (2^5) = 32px -- for larger cards & grid gap
   a. Vertical spacing (2^5) = 64px -- will use to separate most vertical components / sections
